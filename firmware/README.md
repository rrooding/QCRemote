# Firmware (NXP FRDM-RW612)

Target board: `frdm_rw612` (see [ADR 0002](../docs/adr/0002-devkit-selection.md) for why).
Zephyr, C++23 (see [CODING_STANDARDS.md](../CODING_STANDARDS.md)).

## Layout

```
firmware/
└── app/            # the actual Zephyr application (out-of-tree, "freestanding")
    ├── CMakeLists.txt
    ├── prj.conf
    └── src/Main.cpp
```

This repo does **not** vendor its own `west.yml`/manifest. `firmware/app` is a standard
out-of-tree Zephyr application that builds against a Zephyr workspace you set up separately
(the usual pattern for a monorepo that also holds non-firmware code, like `CODING_STANDARDS.md`
and the future `app/` JUCE client — a nested west manifest here would otherwise turn the
whole `west update` into siblings of this repo's *parent* directory, not a subfolder of it).
If that becomes annoying, revisit — this is a convention, not an ADR-level decision.

## One-time setup

Follow Zephyr's own [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html)
to install the toolchain and SDK, then create a workspace pinned to the release this project
targets (v4.4.2, current stable as of writing — confirmed `frdm_rw612` and `CONFIG_STD_CPP23`
both exist in this release):

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.venv/zephyr
source ~/.venv/zephyr/bin/activate
pip install west

west init -m https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr --mr v4.4.2 ~/zephyrproject
cd ~/zephyrproject
west update
west packages pip --install
west sdk install
```

BLE (for MVP2) needs NXP's binary blobs — fetch them now so they're not a surprise later:

```bash
west blobs fetch hal_nxp
```

## Build

```bash
west build -b frdm_rw612 /path/to/QCRemote/firmware/app --pristine
```

Drop `--pristine` on subsequent builds once the build directory exists.

## Flash

The FRDM-RW612's onboard **MCU-Link** probe, at least on the unit this was verified against,
enumerates as **SEGGER J-Link** (`system_profiler`/`ioreg` show `USB Vendor Name: SEGGER`,
`USB Product Name: J_Link`) — not CMSIS-DAP. So the `jlink` runner `west flash` tries by
default is the correct one; you just need SEGGER's tools installed.

Install the **J-Link Software and Documentation Pack** for your OS from
[segger.com/downloads/jlink](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/) (no account needed),
then confirm `JLinkExe` is on `PATH` (SEGGER's installer typically symlinks it into
`/usr/local/bin` automatically):

```bash
which JLinkExe
```

Then just:

```bash
west flash
```

If your board's probe turns out to be running CMSIS-DAP firmware instead (NXP ships MCU-Link
boards both ways depending on batch/board revision — verify with `system_profiler
SPUSBDataTree` or `ioreg -p IOUSB -l | grep -i "USB Vendor Name\|USB Product Name"` before
assuming either way), use `west flash --runner linkserver` instead, which needs NXP's
**LinkServer** utility installed and on `PATH` (via the
[MCUXpresso Installer](https://www.nxp.com/mcuxpresso/installer) or the standalone
[LinkServer installer](https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/software/development-software/mcuxpresso-software-and-tools-/linkserver-for-microcontrollers:LINKERSERVER)).

## Verify

Console output (`zephyr,console` is UART, `flexcomm3`) should show:

```
QC Bridge firmware skeleton up (C++202302)
```

and the onboard green LED should blink at ~1Hz. This confirms the toolchain, board target,
and C++23 configuration all work end-to-end before any real protocol code lands (issues
[#3](https://github.com/rrooding/QCRemote/issues/3) onward).

## Not yet done

- Hardware-in-the-loop verification of the above (needs the physical board) — this repo
  content is unverified against real hardware; flag any discrepancy found when you run it.
- ETL is wired in via CMake `FetchContent` (see `app/CMakeLists.txt`) but not yet used by
  any code.
