This repo does **not** vendor its own `west.yml`/manifest. `firmware/app` is a standard
out-of-tree Zephyr application that builds against a Zephyr workspace you set up separately
(the usual pattern for a monorepo that also holds non-firmware code, like `CODING_STANDARDS.md`
and the future `app/` JUCE client — a nested west manifest here would otherwise turn the
whole `west update` into siblings of this repo's *parent* directory, not a subfolder of it).
If that becomes annoying, revisit — this is a convention, not an ADR-level decision.

## One-time setup

Follow Zephyr's own [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html)
to install the toolchain and SDK, then create a workspace pinned to the release this project
targets (v4.5.0, current stable as of writing — confirmed `frdm_rw612` and `CONFIG_STD_CPP23`
both exist in this release):

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.venv/zephyr
source ~/.venv/zephyr/bin/activate
pip install west

west init -m https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr --mr v4.5.0 ~/zephyrproject
cd ~/zephyrproject
west update
west packages pip --install
west sdk install
```

BLE (for MVP2) needs NXP's binary blobs — fetch them now so they're not a surprise later:

```bash
west blobs fetch hal_nxp
```

## Build

```bash
west build -b frdm_rw612 /path/to/QCRemote/firmware/app --pristine
```

Drop `--pristine` on subsequent builds once the build directory exists.

## Flash

The FRDM-RW612's onboard **MCU-Link** probe, at least on the unit this was verified against,
enumerates as **SEGGER J-Link** (`system_profiler`/`ioreg` show `USB Vendor Name: SEGGER`,
`USB Product Name: J_Link`) — not CMSIS-DAP. So the `jlink` runner `west flash` tries by
default is the correct one; you just need SEGGER's tools installed.

Install the **J-Link Software and Documentation Pack** for your OS from
[segger.com/downloads/jlink](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/) (no account needed),
then confirm `JLinkExe` is on `PATH` (SEGGER's installer typically symlinks it into
`/usr/local/bin` automatically):

```bash
which JLinkExe
```

Then just:

```bash
west flash
```

If your board's probe turns out to be running CMSIS-DAP firmware instead (NXP ships MCU-Link
boards both ways depending on batch/board revision — verify with `system_profiler
SPUSBDataTree` or `ioreg -p IOUSB -l | grep -i "USB Vendor Name\|USB Product Name"` before
assuming either way), use `west flash --runner linkserver` instead, which needs NXP's
**LinkServer** utility installed and on `PATH` (via the
[MCUXpresso Installer](https://www.nxp.com/mcuxpresso/installer) or the standalone
[LinkServer installer](https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/software/development-software/mcuxpresso-software-and-tools-/linkserver-for-microcontrollers:LINKERSERVER)).

## Verify

Open a serial monitor on the probe's USB-CDC port (`zephyr,console` is UART, `flexcomm3`,
bridged over USB by the J-Link probe) — either `screen /dev/tty.usbmodemNNNN 115200` or
[`tio`](https://github.com/tio/tio) (`tio /dev/tty.usbmodemNNNN`), whichever's installed.
There are two `usbmodem` devices from the probe; the console is the first one enumerated.

```

and the onboard green LED blinks at ~1Hz. Confirms the toolchain, board target, and C++23
configuration all work end-to-end before any real protocol code lands (issues
[#3](https://github.com/rrooding/QCRemote/issues/3) onward).

## USB host bring-up (issue #3)

`boards/frdm_rw612.overlay` switches the RW612's single USB-OTG peripheral from device mode
(the board default) to host mode. `prj.conf` enables `CONFIG_USB_HOST_STACK` (Zephyr's
`[EXPERIMENTAL]` USB host stack — see [ADR 0002](../docs/adr/0002-devkit-selection.md) for
the accepted risk); the NXP EHCI controller driver auto-selects itself once the devicetree
node is enabled.

**Zephyr's public USB host headers don't compile as C++** (confirmed against a real build,
Zephyr v4.4.2): `zephyr/usb/usbh.h` has a struct field literally named `class`, and
`zephyr/drivers/usb/uhc.h` relies on C's implicit `void*` conversions in several inline
functions. Both are genuine bugs in Zephyr's public API, not something fixable from the C++
side — worth reporting upstream.

The fix is [`usbh_shim.c`](app/src/usbh_shim.c)/[`usbh_shim.h`](app/src/usbh_shim.h): a plain
C file (compiled under C, where neither issue applies) exposing a minimal, C++-safe API —
register a VID/PID filter and three callbacks, get the USB host controller started. It also
depends on `subsys/usb/host`'s internal headers (`usbh_class.h`, `usbh_desc.h`), which aren't
part of Zephyr's public API but which every USB host class driver needs, including Zephyr's
own in-tree ones (MSC, UAC2, UVC) — `CMakeLists.txt` adds `${ZEPHYR_BASE}/subsys/usb/host` as
an include path to reach them.

[`UsbHostClass.hpp`](app/src/UsbHostClass.hpp) wraps that shim in a small, generic C++ base
class (`OnInit()`/`OnProbe()`/`OnRemoved()` virtuals) so nothing outside `usbh_shim.c` ever
includes a Zephyr USB header. `QcHidBridge` ([src/QcHidBridge.hpp](app/src/QcHidBridge.hpp))
subclasses it: filters for the Quad Cortex Mini's VID/PID (`0x152A`/`0x892F`, per
[qc-mcp](https://github.com/lexasoft123/qc-mcp)) and claims only interface 5 (the vendor HID
control interface), rejecting every other interface the composite device exposes. `Main.cpp`
just owns a `QcHidBridge` and calls `Start()` — no USB host plumbing visible there at all.

No transfers are submitted yet — `shim_completion_cb` in `usbh_shim.c` is a stub returning
`-ENOTSUP` — that lands with the HID framing and session-handshake work (issues #4-#8).

**Verified 2026-09-15** against a real Quad Cortex Mini:

```
*** Booting Zephyr OS build v4.4.2 ***
<inf> main: QC Bridge firmware skeleton up (C++202302)
<inf> main: USB host enabled, waiting for Quad Cortex Mini
<inf> usbh_dev: New device with address 1 state 2
<inf> usbh_dev: Configuration 1 bNumInterfaces 6
<inf> main: Claimed Quad Cortex Mini HID interface 5
```

The device enumerates as a composite audio+HID device (6 interfaces), consistent with
qc-mcp's findings, and interface 5 is correctly claimed.

One thing learned along the way, now baked into the design: with a `NULL`/VID-PID-only
class filter, Zephyr's USB host stack calls `probe()` **once per device**, not once per
interface — it hands back `USBH_CLASS_IFNUM_DEVICE` (255), a sentinel, not a real interface
number. `usbh_shim.c` looks up the target interface (5) itself via `usbh_desc_get_iface()`
rather than trusting the `iface` argument `probe()` receives; `qc_usbh_filter` carries that
target interface number alongside vid/pid.

## HID report framing (issue #4, part 1 of 2)

[`HidReassembler.hpp`](app/src/HidReassembler.hpp) (reports in, one logical message out) and
[`HidChunker.hpp`](app/src/HidChunker.hpp) (a message in, reports out) implement qc-mcp's
129-byte HID report framing (1 report-id byte + a 128-byte body: chunk length + flags +
up to 126 bytes of payload — see `transport.py`'s `REPORT_SIZE`/`message_to_reports()`, which
allocates `1 + REPORT_SIZE`). Both are plain C++23 with no Zephyr dependency at all — verified
by compiling and running their test cases directly with the system's `clang++` (no Zephyr SDK
needed) before porting the same cases into the Ztest suite below.

**Correction, found and confirmed during #7's hardware verification**: this was originally
implemented as 128 bytes *total* (report id counted as part of the 128), one byte short of
qc-mcp's actual wire format. On real hardware this produced a spurious trailing 1-byte "report"
after every legitimate message - the device's actual 129-byte input report was being split by
our too-small receive buffer (`QC_USBH_REPORT_SIZE`) into a 128-byte transfer plus a 1-byte
leftover, which our strict "exactly `kHidReportSize` bytes or it's malformed" check then
rejected. Corrected `kHidReportSize` and `QC_USBH_REPORT_SIZE` to 129 to match `transport.py`
exactly; re-verified on hardware - each input report now arrives as a single 129-byte transfer,
no trailing fragment. (The handshake's outgoing `SET_REPORT` also failed at the same time, with
`-EPIPE` - that turned out to be unrelated to this off-by-one; see #7's section below.)

Run the tests:

```bash
west twister -p native_sim -T firmware/app/tests/hid_framing
```

**`native_sim` only runs on a Linux host** — it uses actual Linux syscalls, not a portable
POSIX layer, so on macOS this will always report "FILTERED: Native platform requires Linux."
That's expected, not a bug; it's what CI (presumably a Linux runner) will use. For local
testing on macOS, use a QEMU-emulated target instead, overriding the testcase's
`platform_allow` for this one run:

```bash
west twister -p qemu_cortex_m3 -K -T firmware/app/tests/hid_framing
```

**Verified 2026-09-15**: all 7 test cases pass on `qemu_cortex_m3`. Needed one additional fix
along the way — `CONFIG_REQUIRES_FULL_LIBCPP=y` (now in both `prj.conf` files), since Zephyr's
default `MINIMAL_LIBCPP` doesn't provide `<span>` (or `<cerrno>` — see `UsbHostClass.hpp`'s
history) at all. Confirmed against the pinned v4.4.2 `lib/cpp/Kconfig` source, not assumed.

## HID report transport (issue #4, part 2 of 2)

`usbh_shim.c` now discovers interface 5's actual IN/OUT endpoint addresses (walking its
descriptors via `usbh_desc_get_next()` until the next interface descriptor, right after
`onProbe()` accepts the device) and starts a continuous receive loop on the IN endpoint:
allocate a report-sized buffer, submit it, and on every completion hand the bytes to
`on_report_in()` and immediately re-arm with a fresh buffer. `qc_usbh_send_report()` submits
one report on the OUT endpoint the same way, for whenever there's something to send (that's
issue #7 — nothing calls it yet).

This is modeled directly on `subsys/usb/host/class/usbh_uvc.c`'s `initiate_transfer`/
`continue_transfer` pattern — the only in-tree, merged USB host class driver that actually
moves data, and the closest thing to a proven reference for this part of the API. Every
field/function name (`xfer->buf`, `xfer->err`, `usbh_xfer_alloc`, `net_buf_add_mem`, ...) was
checked against the pinned v4.4.2 source before use, not assumed from newer docs.

`QcHidBridge` now owns a `HidReassembler` and feeds every received report into it, logging
the byte count on each successfully reassembled message.

**Verified 2026-09-15** against a real Quad Cortex Mini:

```
<inf> main: Claimed Quad Cortex Mini HID interface 5
<inf> usbh_shim: Found endpoint 0x81, attributes 0x03, wMaxPacketSize 128
<inf> usbh_shim: Interface 5 endpoints: IN=0x81 OUT=0x00
<inf> usbh_shim: Starting receive loop on IN endpoint 0x81
```

No data arrived while the device sat connected — expected, not a gap: qc-mcp's protocol
means the device stays silent until the session handshake (#7) exists, so this is the
*correct* result, not a missing feature. Disconnecting the device produced:

```
<wrn> usbh_shim: IN transfer completed with error: -5
```

`-5` is `-EIO` — the pending transfer correctly erroring out on physical disconnect, which
also confirms the completion/error-handling path actually works (not just the happy path).
Reconnecting cleanly re-ran the whole enumerate → claim → discover → receive sequence.

Between endpoint discovery working, the receive loop starting, and the disconnect exercising
real error handling, every phase of #4's transport plumbing has now been exercised against
real hardware — the remaining gap (actually reading a reassembled message) needs the session
handshake from #7, which is genuinely out of scope here, not a shortfall of this issue.

**Confirmed limitation, feeds directly into #7**: interface 5 has exactly one endpoint (the
IN one above) — no interrupt OUT endpoint exists. `qc_usbh_send_report()` as currently
written always fails with `-ENODEV`; sending will need HID's `SET_REPORT` control transfer
on endpoint 0 instead. Documented in `usbh_shim.h` and on issue #7.

## Session handshake (issue #7)

[`QcSession.hpp`](app/src/QcSession.hpp) sends `ResetCommsBuffers` UPDATE, `Version` READ
then UPDATE (mirroring the device's own reported firmware version, falling back to a fixed
string if no reply arrives in time — qc-mcp's `transport.py::_handshake()` does the same,
with an even shorter 150ms window), and `Connection` UPDATE on a dedicated thread, per
PROTOCOL.md section 3. `qc_usbh_send_report()`'s `SET_REPORT` control transfer
(`usbh_shim.c`) is what actually gets the handshake messages onto the wire, since interface
5 has no interrupt OUT endpoint (see above).

**Verified 2026-10-31** against a real Quad Cortex Mini:

```
<inf> main: Claimed Quad Cortex Mini HID interface 5 (sub=0, proto=0)
<inf> usbh_shim: Found endpoint 0x81, attributes 0x03, wMaxPacketSize 128
<inf> usbh_shim: Interface 5 endpoints: IN=0x81
<inf> usbh_shim: Starting receive loop on IN endpoint 0x81
<inf> usbh_shim: IN transfer completed: 129 bytes
<inf> main: Reassembled message: 41 bytes
<wrn> main: No usable Version reply (gotReply=0), using fallback 4.1.0
<inf> main: Session handshake complete (firmware version: 4.1.0)
<inf> usbh_shim: IN transfer completed: 129 bytes
<inf> usbh_shim: IN transfer completed: 129 bytes
<inf> usbh_shim: IN transfer completed: 129 bytes
<inf> main: Reassembled message: 331 bytes
<inf> usbh_shim: IN transfer completed: 129 bytes
<inf> main: Reassembled message: 10 bytes
<inf> usbh_shim: IN transfer completed: 129 bytes
<inf> main: Reassembled message: 14 bytes
```

Right after "Session handshake complete", the device starts pushing data unprompted — the
"burst of state READs" PROTOCOL.md §3 step 4 describes (`ModelRepo`, `ModuleStats`, etc.),
which only happens once the device treats the session as live. That's the real confirmation
here, not just "no error was logged": the device's own behavior changed because it now
considers this a connected session, matching Cortex Control's own effect on it.

**Hardware surprise, now a documented and handled quirk**: `qc_usbh_send_report()`'s
`SET_REPORT` call returns `-EPIPE` (a stall) on *every* send to this device, including in
this trace, even though the handshake plainly works (see the burst above). This isn't a
parameter bug — confirmed by reading the device's actual HID report descriptor for the
first time (`05 01 09 00 a1 01 15 00 26 ff 00 85 01 75 08 95 80 09 00 81 82 85 02 75 08 95
80 09 00 91 82 c0`, decoded: Report ID 1 = 128-byte Input, Report ID 2 = 128-byte Output),
which matches `qc_usbh_send_report()`'s construction exactly (wValue `0x0202`, wLength 129).
`GET_REPORT` for both report IDs succeeds cleanly; only the OUT direction stalls, regardless
of data-phase encoding (tried both with and without the report id byte duplicated in the
data). It turns out this is already documented: PROTOCOL.md §1 — *"macOS quirk:
`IOHIDDeviceSetReport` returns a benign `0xe0005000` on this device — the official app
ignores it too, and the data is still sent. Not an error."* A stall on the control
endpoint's status stage self-clears on the next SETUP packet (unlike other endpoints, which
need an explicit `CLEAR_FEATURE`), consistent with the data having actually landed despite
the reported error. `QcSession::sendMessage()` now treats `-EPIPE` specifically as
non-fatal and continues, matching what every reference implementation already does.

## Zephyr 4.5 upgrade (issue #54)

Bumped the pinned release from v4.4.2 to v4.5.0 (released 2026-10-28). As scoped in #54,
this surfaced exactly one break in code this project depends on, not the zero predicted by
the header diff that scoped the issue: `usbh_device.h`'s `usbh_xfer_free()` wrapper was
removed upstream ([`usb: host: replace usbh_xfer_free() with uhc_xfer_unref()`](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/commit/b7b06c6740c4425fd15dc3226f3688dee453669d),
landed after the API diff #54 checked was done) — the underlying `uhc_xfer_free(dev, xfer)`
is still there, but the convenience wrapper our shim called is gone in favor of a ref-counted
`uhc_xfer_unref(xfer)` (no `dev` argument). `usbh_shim.c`'s `start_receiving()` error path
was the one remaining call site after rebasing onto #7/#53's session-handshake work, which
had already replaced the old async OUT-endpoint send path (and its own two call sites) with
`qc_usbh_send_report()`'s `usbh_req_setup()` control transfer above; every other API this
project touches (`usbh_xfer_alloc()`, `usbh_desc_get_next()`/`usbh_desc_get_iface()`, the
`usbh_class_data`/`usbh_class_filter` structs) was unaffected, matching what #54 found.

Rebuilt `frdm_rw612` clean against the v4.5.0 workspace (succeeds), and re-ran both Ztest
suites (`hid_framing`, `protocol_messages`) on `qemu_cortex_m3` — all 24 cases still pass.
`frdm_rw612` and `CONFIG_STD_CPP23` both still exist in v4.5.0, confirmed directly against
the checked-out source, not assumed.

**Verified 2026-10-31** against a real Quad Cortex Mini on the v4.5.0 build: the full
enumerate → claim → discover → receive → session-handshake flow this file documents above
still works end-to-end.
